# HTNPlanValidation
In this repository you can find Mgr. Simona Ondrckova's implementations of a plan validation alghorithm.The algorithm was created by Prof. RNDr. Roman Bart√°k, Ph.D. et all. 
To run either one of the programs give them three arguments in this order: domain, problem, plan.
If you don't give them any arguments, they will search for these files in their folder: "domain.lisp" "problem" and "plan.txt".
