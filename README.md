# HTNPlanValidation
In this repository you can find Simona Ondrckova's implementations of plan recognition and plan validation alghorithms.The algorithms were created by Prof. RNDr. Roman Bart√°k, Ph.D.. 
To run either one of the programs give them three arguments in this order: domain, problem, plan.
If you don't give them any arguments, they will search for these files in their folder: "domain.lisp" "problem" and "plan.txt".
