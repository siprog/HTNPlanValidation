In this repository you can find Mgr. Simona Ondrckova's implementations of a plan validation alghorithm.The algorithm was created by Prof. RNDr. Roman Barták, Ph.D. et al. This is the version of the alghorithm presented in article Roman Barták et al. A Novel Parsing-based Approach for Verification of Hierarchical Plans,which was published at ICTAI in 2020: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9288328

To run the program give it three arguments in this order: domain, problem, plan.
If you don't give it any arguments, it will search for these files in its folder: "domain.lisp" "problem" and "plan.txt".
